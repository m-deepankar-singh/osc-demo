[00:00:56] Hello, Orbit friends.
[00:00:57] Welcome to the course on applying self-awareness.
[00:01:00] At the beginning of this video, you have seen an illustration of someone who is applying a method to develop self-awareness.
[00:01:06] Let's take a look at this video to find out other ways to develop and improve self-awareness.
[00:01:12] However, before going deeper into learning how to develop and improve self-awareness.
[00:01:17] Let's explore how you can apply it in your daily life or work.
[00:01:21] Here are some elements you need to have to develop self-awareness.
[00:01:25] The first awareness, this means being aware of your internal experiences, including your emotions and thoughts.
[00:01:35] The second, self-knowledge.
[00:01:38] This element is focused on your understanding of who you are, including your beliefs, values, and motivations.
[00:01:46] The next, emotional intelligence.
[00:01:49] This element is focused on the ability to understand and manage emotions.
[00:01:58] The next, self-acceptance.
[00:02:02] This aspect centers on accepting who you are and showing yourself compassion and kindness.
[00:02:09] The last, self-reflection.
[00:02:12] This element involves the ability to think deeply about your feelings, thoughts, and goals to gain a better understanding of who you are and your place in the world.
[00:02:24] Well, after you know what elements you need to have to develop self-awareness, next we will find out.
[00:02:30] How to develop self-awareness.
[00:02:33] There are several ways to develop self-awareness.
[00:02:36] Keep in mind that this takes time and work.
[00:02:39] First, make a list of your strengths and weaknesses.
[00:02:43] You can start building self-awareness by learning where you are strongest and weakest.
[00:02:47] Do a personal SWOT analysis, or strengths, weakness, opportunities, threats analysis, to get a better understanding of this.
[00:02:56] You may also want to take the Strengths Finder self test, which helps you identify your five greatest strengths.
[00:03:02] When you understand how your personality compares to the others, you can discover what motivates you, and how you relate to the world.
[00:03:13] Both of these are important aspects of self-awareness.
[00:03:17] This is where personality tests such as the Big Five Personality Model and Myers Briggs can be valuable tools for self-discovery.
[00:03:28] The second, reflect on the impact of what you have.
[00:03:32] When you are self-aware, you understand how you instinctively think, connect with others, communicate, and make decisions.
[00:03:43] A useful method to understand these aspects is by maintaining a journal.
[00:03:48] This helps you evaluate what works and doesn't work for you and enhances your awareness of your impact on others.
[00:03:54] Another way to improve self-awareness and reduce stress is through meditation.
[00:03:59] Alternatively, you can set aside some time in the evening to quietly reflect on your day, considering your interactions with others.
[00:04:06] What do you do so well?
[00:04:08] And what could you do better?
[00:04:11] The third, focus on others.
[00:04:14] People with self-awareness understand how their words and actions impact others.
[00:04:19] To become more aware of your influence on others, you must manage your emotions.
[00:04:24] Take the time to weigh what you're saying carefully and think about how it will affect the person you're talking to.
[00:04:30] Humility is an important part of this.
[00:04:33] When you are humble, you focus your attention and energy on others and not on yourself.
[00:04:38] The fourth, ask for feedback.
[00:04:41] Getting feedback is important for developing self-awareness.
[00:04:44] You can get feedback from your colleagues, coworkers, and team members, either with direct questions or with 360 degrees feedback.
[00:04:53] When you ask for feedback from those around you, it gives you a chance to see your behavior from their point of view.
[00:04:59] Furthermore, it can help you identify weaknesses that you can't see or that you'd rather ignore.
[00:05:05] By developing self-awareness, you know what works and doesn't work for you, and you learn how to manage your impact on others.
[00:05:12] People with high levels of self-awareness are more effective as leaders because they deal with people positively, and they inspire trust and credibility in their team members.
[00:05:22] As a result, people who have high self-awareness also often have more fulfilling careers and higher income.
[00:05:30] To develop self-awareness, learn about your strengths and weaknesses.
[00:05:37] Take the time to analyze the decisions you make.
[00:05:40] Focus on managing your emotions and be humble about your accomplishments.
[00:05:47] Well, that's the discussion about applying self-awareness.
[00:05:51] You can learn more about this in the reading materials.
[00:05:54] Inspirational greetings.
[00:05:57] Good luck is always with you.
[00:05:59] Thank you.

[00:00:48] This makes it easier to reflect on ourselves, explore new experiences, observe, and control our emotions.
[00:00:56] Psychologists reveal that another term for self-awareness is metamood or metacognition.
[00:01:11] These terms refer to a person's awareness of their thought processes and emotions.
[00:01:29] The existence of the process of metacognition enables individuals to control all of their cognitive activities.

[00:05:34] Identifying your emotions and what you feel.

[00:05:46] But being able to identify your emotions can help you better understand yourself and your reactions to different situations.
[00:05:55] Then, how can we know that a person has high awareness?
[00:05:57] According to Adams in 2008, a person who has high self-awareness has the following characteristics:

[00:07:44] Asking others to respond does not mean that we rely on their opinions, but rather that their opinions will help us to know things that we might not be aware of.

[00:01:30] Hello Orbit friends.
[00:01:30] Welcome to the course on Self understanding.
[00:01:34] At the beginning of this video, you have watched things related to understanding yourself.
[00:01:45] Before we go into the process of understanding ourselves, let's begin by understanding the meaning of understand yourself.
[00:01:50] What is understanding yourself?
[00:01:55] Self-understanding is the effort to recognize and comprehend one's strengths and weaknesses, allowing for better control of one's actions when dealing with others or oneself.
[00:02:12] Then, how do you understand yourself?
[00:02:15] There are 10 ways to understand yourself.
[00:02:16] The first, know and understand your strengths and weaknesses.
[00:02:28] Record at least five of each to better understand your limitations.
[00:02:32] This can provide enthusiasm and self-motivation to continue developing in a better direction.
[00:02:40] Recognizing one's weaknesses is not about self-deprecation but serves as a tool for self-improvement to overcome areas we consider weak.
[00:02:50] The second, observe mastered and least mastered fields.
[00:02:55] Begin by observing the fields you have mastered and fields you have less expertise.
[00:03:00] This will help you discover your own interests and potentials.
[00:03:03] Recognizing these things can help in determining your life path and understanding that we, as humans, have our own limitations.
[00:03:12] The third, be honest with yourself.
[00:03:16] When we understand ourselves, it means that we accept various perspectives that shape us, including our personality, identity, and our current existence.
[00:03:25] This method can help uncover aspects of our personality, but it is important to emphasize that it is not intended for self-criticism.
[00:03:36] When you want to evaluate, observe and be honest with yourself, consider what makes you feel uncomfortable.
[00:03:42] This feeling can be a sign that you are avoiding something, but it is also valid because we all have preferences, and not everything we will like.
[00:03:51] When you're able to recognize when you're not being true to yourself, you'll feel that your life doesn't match your own values or that you're not being honest with yourself about what you want.
[00:04:00] Being able to recognize this can help you make changes in your life that will lead to greater happiness and fulfillment.
[00:04:07] The fourth, listen to your inner voice.
[00:04:13] Try to learn to listen to and understand your inner voice.
[00:04:16] Your inner voice describes your feelings and self-confidence.
[00:04:19] It can also indicate something pleasant or even annoying.
[00:04:23] If you have negative thoughts about yourself, pause and ask why they came up.
[00:04:30] It indicates self-criticism.
[00:04:33] Criticizing ourselves is not forbidden.
[00:04:36] In fact, it can sometimes indicate that we are protecting ourselves from unpleasant thoughts.
[00:04:41] In other words, both positive and negative thoughts serve as responses to ourselves.
[00:04:48] If the response is not as expected, strive to improve yourself in a more positive direction.
[00:04:57] The fifth, focus on your daily life.
[00:05:00] Practice focusing your attention during your daily activities.
[00:05:06] In doing so, you'll gain a deeper understanding of what's happening and become more aware of your thoughts and actions.
[00:05:10] There are several important points that can be done to focus on yourself.
[00:05:13] Try not to multitask.
[00:05:14] For instance, avoid eating while using gadgets or watching television.
[00:05:19] Learn to fully appreciate the activities and the time you're experiencing.
[00:05:25] The sixth.
[00:05:25] Learn to describe yourself.
[00:05:27] Try describing your appearance, including your physical attributes.
[00:05:32] If the description tends to be negative, try to find something positive about yourself.
[00:05:38] Learn to appreciate your physique more.
[00:05:41] Let's take an example, if your black skin makes you feel insecure, change those thoughts into positive perceptions.
[00:05:48] For example, think of the skin color you have as an attraction or uniqueness in itself.
[00:05:52] That way, you can better appreciate what you have.
[00:05:55] No one in this world is perfect; everyone has their own shortcomings and weaknesses.
[00:06:03] The seventh.
[00:06:04] Realize and understand your role in life.
[00:06:08] Understand your various roles in everyday life, whether in the family, workplace, school, campus, organization, or the community.
[00:06:17] Then, explain the role you are currently playing.
[00:06:20] For example, the role as a parent or child in the family.
[00:06:23] The role as a team leader or member in the organization.
[00:06:27] Or the role as a student in the school or campus environment.
[00:06:32] The eighth.
[00:06:33] Ask for feedback from others.
[00:06:37] Asking others to respond does not mean that we rely on their opinions, but rather that their opinions will help us to know things that we might not be aware of.
[00:06:45] Ask those closest to you, such as family members, friends, or relatives, about their perspective on your personality and traits.
[00:06:53] The ninth.
[00:06:54] Define your vision and mission.
[00:06:58] Your vision and mission encompass your future goals, dreams, and aspirations.
[00:07:04] They serve as the first step in determining the path we want to take in our future lives.
